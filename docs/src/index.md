# StreetCars

Documentation for [StreetCars.jl](https://github.com/zakzo1212/StreetCars.jl). StreetCars.jl builds upon Guillaume Dalle'sHashCode2014.jl package to provide a Julia interface for the Google Hash Code 2014 problem, and uses many of the samefunctions and data structures. Guillaume's package is available [here](https://gdalle.github.io/HashCode2014.jl/dev/), and it's functions and data structures are defined again in this package for convenience as well.
